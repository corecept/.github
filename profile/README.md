## 🎬 **CoreCept**

### A creator group making fun YouTube content — and sharing the tech behind it.

Welcome to the official **CoreCept** GitHub!
We’re a group of people making YouTube videos, and this org is just our place to store:

* 🖥️ Source code used in videos
* 🌐 Server files & configs
* 🛠️ Tools or scripts we create
* 📦 Open-source stuff for our community

Nothing fancy — just transparency and resources for anyone who wants to explore our backend magic ✨
